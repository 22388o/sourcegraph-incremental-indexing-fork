## How Code Insights Work 

Code Insights are powered by Sourcegraph's universal code search. By using [Sourcegraph's search language's](../../code_search/reference/queries.md) `before:` and `count:` keywords, Sourcegraph can find the version of your code that existed at any point in time. Then Code Insights can run a search for the specific piece of information you're tracking and collect the results into a total count.
