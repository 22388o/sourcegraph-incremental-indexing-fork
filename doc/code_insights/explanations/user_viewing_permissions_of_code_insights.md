# User Viewing Permissions of Code Insights

When a user views a code insight, the code insight runs with that user's permissions. This means that the code insight will not contain any information from or about repositories a user doesn't have access to see, even if the user who created the code insight could view additional repositories. 

To control whether or not users can see code insights that you have created, see TODO TODO link.
